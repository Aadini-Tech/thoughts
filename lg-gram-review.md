# My Lg Gram - buying journey
I was looking for a laptop for my projects.  I have been using a Macbook(company provided) for the past 7 years.
So I like the 16:10 aspect ratio and a high-resolution screen on Mac. I wanted a similar spec for my Windows laptop.

## Following are my criteria for the windows laptop
- 16:10 aspect ratio. The 3:2 or 5:4 aspect ratio is even better. but those are rare or too costly
- high resolution: 2.5K  to start with.
- good keyboard WITHOUT numpad. I rarely use Numpad. I feel NumPad is a distraction and occupies important keyboards' real estate.
- minimum 16 GB of RAM. I wanted a laptop with 32 GB. However, laptops with higher ram config are too costly or they are bulky gaming/workstation laptops.
- optional GPU with 4 GB ram (Nvidia RTX 3050)



## Final list of contenders
- ASUS Zenbook 14-inch line ups - It was good to see ASUS India release its latest 2023 (Ryzen 7000) model in India sooner. It was just released in MWC 2023.
    ### - ASUS Zenbook 14-inch models checked most of the checkboxes.
     - High resolution - 16:10 screen with 600nits brightness
     - decent lpddr4x 4300 speed
     - Latest power-efficient AMD Ryzen 7000 series CPUs
     - Choice of LED and OLED models
     - Ryzen 7, 1TB, 16GB OLED model was at 108K.
     - Two thunderbolts 4 ports
     - Only missing thing was an option for bigger-screen laptops

    ### - ASUS's entry-level Vivobook lineup has a 16inch FHD + (16:10) model for just 70K - 16GB, the Same ryzen 7 7000 CPU
       - the missing things are
            - lower the 2.5K resolution.
            - Low-speed RAM 3.2K.
            - Keyboard with numpad - and quality of the keyboard.
            - barrel charger - I prefer a type-c charger as all other devices support type-c charging. including my hair trimmer.

    ### - Xiaomibook 120G - it was the one on my list for a long time.
    - not so old intel 12th gen core i5 CPU
    - faster 5200 K DDR5 Ram
    - 2.5K 16:10 screen with decent brightness
    - 70.3K price - (cheapest on my list)
    - Type-C port on either side - more convenience (like the Macbook pro)
    - Macbook pro like build
    - only -ve thing is - No core i7 option (Ok for additional cost)

   

### - LG gram 17 - just stumbled up on the 17in the model was available for less than 90K. which usually sells > 100K
    - Checks most of the boxes
    - 2. K 16:10 350nits screen - 17in size is a BIG plus for a coder.
    - 16 GB 5200 speed DDR5 RAM
    - within my budget
    - additional - very lightweight - < 1.5kg
    - Face login (Window hello)
    - bigger 80kw battery - yet to check the battery drain for my usage.

    - -ve points
        - Keyboard has numpad
        - NO Fingerprint scanner (Just noticed after purchase)
        - Face login was not reliable - sometimes it does not recognize me.


## Final decision
  - on the day of the purchase - there was an Amazon offer on Xiaomi Book - it was available for less than 72k.
  Still, my heart went for LG gram - for the bigger screen and light weight and reliability(some certification).
  - So far I am liking this laptop. I just typed this blog on the same machine.
  - Only thing I overlooked was the missing fingerprint scanner. I am used to the fast fingerprint of my Mac.
  - I miss the same in LG gram.


## Things I did with the new windows laptop
- laptop came with 0% battery. so I just plugged in with the given power adapter - 65-watt type-c
- logged in with my windows account and set up windows hello face login.
- did software updates
- uninstalled bloatware
- Checked the configs - storage/ram/cpu model
- just made sure - the type-c and type-a ports work. tested camera, mic, speaker, Bluetooth, wifi.
