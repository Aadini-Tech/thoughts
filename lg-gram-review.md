# My Lg Gram - buying journey
I was looking for a laptop for my personal projects.  I am a Macbook(company provided) for the past 7years.
So I like the 16:10 aspect ratio and high resolution screen in Mac. I wated similar spec in my windows laptop.

## Following are my criteria for the windows laptop
- 16:10 aspect ratio. 3:2 or 5:4 aspect ratio are even bettet. but those are rare or too costly
- high resolution : 2.5K  to start with.
- good keyboard WITHOUT numpad. I rarely use numpad. I feel numpads are distractions and occupys importact keyboard realestate.
- minimum 16gb of RAM. I wanted laptop with 32 GB. however laptop with higher ram config are too costly or they are bulky gaming/workstation laptops.
- optional of GPU with 4gb ram (nvide rtx 3050)



## Final list of contenders
- ASUS zenbook 14inch line ups - It was good to see ASUS India release its latest 2023 (Ryzen 7000) model in India sooner. Just release in MWC 2023.
    ### - ASUS zenbook 14inch models checked most of the check boxes.
     - High resolution - 16:10 screen with 600nits brightness
     - decent lpddr4x 4300 speed
     - Latest power efficient AMD Ryzen 7000 series CPUs
     - Choice of LED and OLED models 
     - Ryzen 7, 1TB, 16GB OLED model was at 108K.
     - Two thunderbolt 4 ports
     - Only missing thing was a option of bigger screen laptops 

    ### - ASUS's entry level vivobook line up has a 16inch FHD+ (16:10) model for just 70K - 16GB, Same ryzen 7 7000 CPU
       - the missing things are 
            - lower the 2.5K resolution. 
            - Low speed RAM 3.2K. 
            - Keyboard with numpad - and quality of keyboard.
            - barrel charger - I prefer a type-c charger as all other devices support type-c charging. including my hair trimmer.

    ### - Xiaomibook 120G - it was the one in my list for long time.
    - not so old intel 12th gen core i5 cpu
    - faster 5200 K DDR5 Ram
    - 2.5K 16:10 screen with decent brightness
    - 70.3K price - (cheapest in my list)
    - Type-C port on either side - more convinence (like the Macbook pro)
    - Macbook pro like build
    - only -ve thing is - No core i7 option (Ok for additional cost)

    

### - LG gram 17 - just stumbbled up on the 17in model was available for less than 90K. which usually sells > 100K
    - Checks most of the boxes
    - 2.K 16:10 350nits screen - 17in size is a BIG plus for a coder.
    - 16 GB 5200 speed DDR5 RAM
    - with in my budget
    - additional - very light weight - < 1.5kg
    - Face login (Window hello)
    - bigger 80kw battery - yet to check the battery drain for my usage.

    - -ve points 
        - Keyboard has numpad
        - NO Finger print scanner (Just noticed after purchase)
        - Face login was not reliable - some times it does not recognize me.


## Final decision
  - on the day of purchase - there was Amazon offer on Xiaomibook - it was available for less than 72k.
  Still my heart went for LG gram - for the bigger screen and light weight and reliability(some certification).
  - So far I am liking this laptop. I just typed this blog in the same machine.
  - Only thing I over looked was - missing finger printscanner. I am used to the fast finger print of my Mac.
  - I miss the same in LG gram.
