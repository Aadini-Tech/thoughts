# Rebuilding Game-Of-Life app in next.js + shadcn.ui
My first attempt to build this app on Pinecone framework was a good start. But I have to stop the project because of the non-working visualization components(charts).
My second and more successful attempt was with Google appsheet. I could build most of the features required features quickly.
Advantages of using appsheet no-code solutions:
- It was easy to build the app from an existing trello template.
- Charts are supported 
- It was available on both WEB and mobile. I could generate Android API and try it in my mobile.
- I am using this app day-to-day to play my life game :)

Missing peices:
   - I am not sure on - how to make this app usable by other users.
   - Bot feature required paid plan. even though I gave CC details. I could not subscribe to paid plan.
