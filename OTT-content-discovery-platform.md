# App idea - Paarv.ai - An OTT content discovery social media platform
## Problem
We have countless number of OTT platforms to watch content. There is NO easy way to share or rate OTT content.
There are TV apps which do aggregate the content across multiple platforms. There is no standard way of sharing the content's rating/liking with friends and family.
Today people share or ask on Twitter or Facebook about OTT content.

Paarv.ai app is built to address the following problems:
- Search for content with natural languge with multiple filters (content language, OTT platform, average user rating, genre etc)
- Option mark content as 'watched' , 'like/dislike'
- Option to 'rate', comment on a content
- Recommend a content to friends
- Read comments/reviews given by the friends
- Find - what our fiends have watched and liked.
