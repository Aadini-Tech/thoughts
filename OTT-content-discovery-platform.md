# App idea - Paarv.ai - An OTT content discovery social media platform
## Problem
We have countless OTT platforms to watch content. There is NO easy way to share or rate OTT content. There are TV apps that aggregate the content across multiple platforms. There is no standard way of sharing the content's rating/liking with friends and family. Today people share or ask on Twitter/Facebook about OTT content.

- What movie/web series to watch?
- How is the X movie released on the Y platform? is it worth watching?
- Where can I watch X movie?
- Where can I get suggestions from my peers/family members?

## Paarv.ai app is built to address the following problems:

- Search for content with natural language with multiple filters (content language, OTT platform, average user rating, genre, etc)
- Option to mark content as 'watched', 'like/dislike'
- Option to 'rate', comment on a content
- Recommend content to friends
- Read comments/reviews given by the friends
- Find - what our friends have watched and liked.
- Find the hidden gems in vast OTT ocean
