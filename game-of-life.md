# The procastinators life
I am a procatinator. I skip the boring but important tasks. I fill my day by doing less important tasks.
I tend to do the work which gives instant grattification. e.g. my obsession with with gpay enery collection.

To reduce my procatination and improve my life, I wanted to build an todo list app to track my tasks. 
I wanted the app to add score as soon as I complete a task. I also wanted to attach higher value to tasks which are importat.


## Application building
### The friction
As a procastination, I was delaying the app building.
- I had only a personal desktop which does not have good wifi. So It is always kept near router with wired lan connected.
- So I need to connect to the TV as monitor. 
- TV is not always available 
- TV only had FHD display. But I am used to a higher res display (read Macbook)
- So Upgraded my PC to win10 pro and setup remote desktop access.
- I could access the PC from my office provide macbook pro. 
- It was nice, but I was always distracted by the open office work items.
- also there were acidental alt tabs which switches the Mac app.
